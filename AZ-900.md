# 1. Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing
 - #### Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers. You only pay for what you use. The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider. Some example providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.The goal of cloud computing is to make running a business easier and more efficient, whether it's a small start-up or a large enterprise. 
 - #### A ***Virtual Machine*** is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop you're using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux. 
 - #### ***Containers*** provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for applications. They're similar to VMs except they don't require a guest operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is packaged into a "container" and then a standard runtime environment is used to execute the app
 - #### Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by some action
 - #### ***Vertical scaling***, also known as "scaling up", is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory.
 - #### ***Horizontal scaling***, also known as "scaling out", is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. For example, you have more than one server processing incoming requests.
 - #### ***Economies of scale*** is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale. This cost advantage is an important benefit in cloud computing.
 - #### Capital Expenditure (CapEx): CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.
 - #### Operational Expenditure (OpEx): OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it.
 - #### ***Public cloud*** is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date – everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware. 
 - #### In a ***private cloud***, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your organization.
 - #### A ***hybrid cloud*** combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location
 - #### ***Infrastructure as a Service***[IaaS] is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you the most control over the provided hardware that runs your application (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
 - #### ***Platform as a Service***[PaaS] provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure.
 - #### ***Software as a service***(SaaS) is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription. 
> ## Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Azure provides over 100 services that enable you to do everything from running your existing applications on virtual machines to exploring new software paradigms such as intelligent bots and mixed reality.
## Here are just a few kinds of services you'll find on Azure:
 - #### Compute services such as VMs and containers that can run your applications
 - #### Database services that provide both relational and NoSQL choices
 - #### Identity services that help you authenticate and protect your users
 - #### Networking services that connect your datacenter to the cloud, provide high availability or host your DNS domain
 - #### Storage solutions that can accommodate massive amounts of both structured and unstructured data
 - #### AI and machine-learning services can analyze data, text, images, comprehend speech, and make predictions using data — changing the world of agriculture, healthcare, and much more.
 - #### And many more!
# 2. Create an Azure account
 - The Azure free account includes free access to popular Azure products for 12 months, $200 USD credit to spend for the first 30 days, and access to more than 25 products that are always free. This is an excellent way for new users to get started and explore
 - With Azure, you only pay for what you use. You'll receive a monthly invoice with payment instructions provided.
 - When you sign up, an Azure subscription is created by default.
 - When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to. 
 - You might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management purposes.
 - You can Customize billing to meet your needs.
 - Azure offers customers reactive and proactive technical support. Choose the support plan that best meet your needs.
