# 1. Cloud Concepts - Principles of cloud computing
 - #### Cloud computing is renting resources, like storage space or CPU cycles, on another company's computers. You only pay for what you use. The company providing these services is referred to as a cloud provider. Some example providers are Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.The goal of cloud computing is to make running a business easier and more efficient, whether it's a small start-up or a large enterprise. 
 - #### A ***Virtual Machine*** is an emulation of a computer - just like your desktop or laptop you're using now. Each VM includes an operating system and hardware that appears to the user like a physical computer running Windows or Linux. 
 - #### ***Containers*** provide a consistent, isolated execution environment for applications. They're similar to VMs except they don't require a guest operating system. Instead, the application and all its dependencies is packaged into a "container" and then a standard runtime environment is used to execute the app
 - #### Serverless computing lets you run application code without creating, configuring, or maintaining a server. The core idea is that your application is broken into separate functions that run when triggered by some action
 - #### ***Vertical scaling***, also known as "scaling up", is the process of adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. Some examples of vertical scaling are: adding more CPUs, or adding more memory.
 - #### ***Horizontal scaling***, also known as "scaling out", is the process of adding more servers that function together as one unit. For example, you have more than one server processing incoming requests.
 - #### ***Economies of scale*** is the ability to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale. This cost advantage is an important benefit in cloud computing.
 - #### Capital Expenditure (CapEx): CapEx is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost, which has a value that reduces over time.
 - #### Operational Expenditure (OpEx): OpEx is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There's no upfront cost. You pay for a service or product as you use it.
 - #### ***Public cloud*** is the most common deployment model. In this case, you have no local hardware to manage or keep up-to-date – everything runs on your cloud provider's hardware. 
 - #### In a ***private cloud***, you create a cloud environment in your own datacenter and provide self-service access to compute resources to users in your organization.
 - #### A ***hybrid cloud*** combines public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location
 - #### ***Infrastructure as a Service***[IaaS] is the most flexible category of cloud services. It aims to give you the most control over the provided hardware that runs your application (IT infrastructure servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, and operating systems). Instead of buying hardware, with IaaS, you rent it. It's an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the internet.
 - #### ***Platform as a Service***[PaaS] provides an environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications. The goal of PaaS is to help you create an application quickly without managing the underlying infrastructure.
 - #### ***Software as a service***(SaaS) is software that is centrally hosted and managed for the end customer. It is usually based on an architecture where one version of the application is used for all customers, and licensed through a monthly or annual subscription.

 - #### You might want to create additional subscriptions for resource or billing management purposes.
 - #### You can Customize billing to meet your needs.
 - #### Azure offers customers reactive and proactive technical support. Choose the support plan that best meet your needs.
# 3. Core Cloud Services - Introduction to Azure
 - #### Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Azure is a continually expanding set of cloud services that help your organization meet your current and future business challenges. Azure gives you the freedom to build, manage, and deploy applications on a massive global network using your favorite tools and frameworks.
 - #### Tour of Azure services
 - #### Created a website hosted in Azure 
 - #### Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service that enables you to build and host many types of web-based solutions without managing infrastructure.
 - #### The Microsoft Azure Marketplace is an online store that hosts applications that are certified and optimized to run in Azure.
 - #### Create a resource group to hold all the things that we need to create. The resource group allows us to administer all the services, disks, network interfaces, and other elements that potentially make up our solution as a unit.
 - #### The free sandbox allows you to create resources in a subset of the Azure global regions.
 - #### The free sandbox allows you to create resources in a subset of the Azure global regions.
 - #### Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based command-line experience for managing and developing Azure resources. Cloud Shell provides two experiences to choose from, Bash and PowerShell. Both include access to the Azure command-line interface called Azure CLI and to Azure PowerShell.
# 4. Core Cloud Services - Azure architecture and service guarantees
 - #### Microsoft Azure is made up of datacenters located around the globe.
 - #### A region is a geographical area on the planet containing at least one, but potentially multiple datacenters that are nearby and networked together with a low-latency network. Azure intelligently assigns and controls the resources within each region to ensure workloads are appropriately balanced.
 - #### ***When you deploy a resource in Azure, you will often need to choose the region where you want your resource deployed.***
 - #### Azure divides the world into geographies that are defined by geopolitical boundaries or country borders. An Azure geography is a discrete market typically containing two or more regions that preserve data residency and compliance boundaries.
 - #### Availability Zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.Each Availability Zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. It is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one zone goes down, the other continues working. Availability Zones are connected through high-speed, private fiber-optic networks.
 - #### Each Azure region is always paired with another region within the same geography (such as US, Europe, or Asia) at least 300 miles away. This approach allows for the replication of resources (such as virtual machine storage) across a geography that helps reduce the likelihood of interruptions due to events such as natural disasters, civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once. If a region in a pair was affected by a natural disaster, for instance, services would automatically fail over to the other region in its region pair.
 - #### Microsoft maintains its commitment to providing customers with high-quality products and services by adhering to comprehensive operational policies, standards, and practices. Formal documents called Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) capture the specific terms that define the performance standards that apply to Azure.
 - #### An SLA defines performance targets for an Azure product or service. The performance targets that an SLA defines are specific to each Azure product and service.
 - #### A typical SLA specifies performance-target commitments that range from 99.9 percent ("three nines") to 99.999 percent ("five nines"), for each corresponding Azure product or service. These targets can apply to such performance criteria as uptime or response times for services.
 - #### SLAs also describe how Microsoft will respond if an Azure product or service fails to perform to its governing SLA's specification.
 - #### When combining SLAs across different service offerings, the resultant SLA is called a Composite SLA. The resulting composite SLA can provide higher or lower uptime values, depending on your application architecture.
 - #### Resiliency is the ability of a system to recover from failures and continue to function. It's not about avoiding failures, but responding to failures in a way that avoids downtime or data loss. The goal of resiliency is to return the application to a fully functioning state following a failure. High availability and disaster recovery are two crucial components of resiliency.
 - #### Availability refers to the time that a system is functional and working. Maximizing availability requires implementing measures to prevent possible service failures. However, devising preventative measures can be difficult and expensive, and often results in complex solutions.
 - #### As your solution grows in complexity, you will have more services depending on each other. Therefore, you might overlook possible failure points in your solution if you have several interdependent services.
# 5. Core Cloud Services - Manage services with the Azure portal
 - #### You can configure and manage Azure using a broad range of tools and platforms. There are tools available for the command line, language-specific Software Development Kits (SDKs), developer tools, tools for migration, and many others.
 - #### The Azure portal is a public website that you can access with any web browser. Once you sign in with your Azure account, you can create, manage, and monitor any available Azure services.
 - #### Azure PowerShell is a module that you can install for Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core, which is a cross-platform version of PowerShell that runs on Windows, Linux, or macOS. ***Azure PowerShell enables you to connect to your Azure subscription and manage resources.*** 
 - #### Azure CLI is a cross-platform command-line program that connects to Azure and executes administrative commands on Azure resources. ***Cross-platform means that it can be run on Windows, Linux, or macOS.***
 - #### Azure Cloud Shell is an interactive, authenticated, browser-accessible shell for managing Azure resources
 - #### The Azure portal is the primary graphical user interface (GUI) for controlling Microsoft Azure.
 - #### The Azure Marketplace allows customers to find, try, purchase, and provision applications and services from hundreds of leading service providers, all certified to run on Azure.
 - #### A ***dashboard*** is a customizable collection of UI tiles displayed in the Azure portal. You add, remove, and position tiles to create the exact view you want, and then save that view as a dashboard. Multiple dashboards are supported, and you can switch between them as needed. You can even share your dashboards with other team members.
 - #### Microsoft offer previews of Azure features for evaluation purposes. With Azure Preview Features, you can test beta and other pre-release features, products, services, software, and regions.
 > - #### Private Preview. An Azure feature marked "private preview" is available to specific Azure customers for evaluation purposes. This is typically by invite only and issued directly by the product team responsible for the feature or service.
 > - #### Public Preview. An Azure feature marked "public preview" is available to all Azure customers for evaluation purposes. These previews can be turned on through the preview features page as detailed below.
# 6. Core Cloud Services - Azure compute options
 - #### Azure compute is an on-demand computing service for running cloud-based applications. It provides computing resources like multi-core processors and supercomputers via virtual machines and containers. It also provides serverless computing to run apps without requiring infrastructure setup or configuration.
 - #### VMs are also an excellent choice when moving from a physical server to the cloud ("lift and shift"). You can create an image of the physical server and host it within a VM with little or no changes. Just like a physical on-premises server, you must maintain the VM. You update the installed OS and the software it runs.
 - #### A container is a modified runtime environment built on top of a host OS that executes your application. A container doesn't use virtualization, so it doesn't waste resources simulating virtual hardware with a redundant OS. This environment typically makes containers more lightweight than VMs.
 - #### The task of automating, managing, and interacting with a large number of containers is known as orchestration. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is a complete orchestration service for containers with distributed architectures with multiple containers.
 - #### Azure App Service enables you to build and host web apps, background jobs, mobile backends, and RESTful APIs in the programming language of your choice without managing infrastructure. 
 - #### Serverless computing is the abstraction of servers, infrastructure, and OSs. With serverless computing, Azure takes care of managing the server infrastructure and allocation/deallocation of resources based on demand. 
 - #### Azure has two implementations of serverless compute:
   - #### Azure Functions, which can execute code in almost any modern language.
   - #### Azure Logic Apps, which are designed in a web-based designer and can execute logic triggered by Azure services without writing any code.  
# 7. Core Cloud Services - Azure data storage options
 - #### The Azure data storage options are cloud-based, secure, and scalable. Its features address the key challenges of cloud storage and provide you with a reliable and durable storage solution.
 - #### Automated backup and recovery: mitigates the risk of losing your data if there is any unforeseen failure or interruption.
 - #### Replication across the globe: copies your data to protect it against any planned or unplanned events, such as scheduled maintenance or hardware failures. You can choose to replicate your data at multiple locations across the globe.
 - #### Support for data analytics: supports performing analytics on your data consumption.
 - #### Encryption capabilities: data is encrypted to make it highly secure; you also have tight control over who can access the data.
 - #### Multiple data types: Azure can store almost any type of data you need. It can handle video files, text files, and even large binary files like virtual hard disks. It also has many options for your relational and NoSQL data.
 - #### Data storage in virtual disks: Azure also has the capability of storing up to 32 TB of data in its virtual disks. This capability is significant when you're storing heavy data such as videos and simulations.
 - #### Storage tiers: storage tiers to prioritize access to data based on frequently used versus rarely used information.
 - #### Types of data:
   - #### Structured data: Structured data is data that adheres to a schema, so all of the data has the same fields or properties
   - #### Semi-structured data: Semi-structured data doesn't fit neatly into tables, rows, and columns. Instead, semi-structured data uses tags or keys that organize and provide a hierarchy for the data.
   - #### Unstructured data. Unstructured data encompasses data that has no designated structure to it. This lack of structure also means that there are no restrictions on the kinds of data it can hold. 
 - #### ***Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE)*** for data at rest helps you secure your data to meet the organization's security and regulatory compliance. It encrypts the data before storing it and decrypts the data before returning it. The encryption and decryption are transparent to the user.
 - #### Client-side encryption is where the data is already encrypted by the client libraries. Azure stores the data in the encrypted state at rest, which is then decrypted during retrieval.
# 8. Core Cloud Services - Azure networking options
 - #### An architectural pattern that can be used to build loosely coupled systems is N-tier.
 - #### An N-tier architecture divides an application into two or more logical tiers. Architecturally, a higher tier can access services from a lower tier, but a lower tier should never access a higher tier.
 - #### Three-tier refers to an n-tier application that has three tiers. Your e-commerce web application follows this three-tier architecture:
   - #### The web tier provides the web interface to your users through a browser.
   - #### The application tier runs business logic.
   - #### The data tier includes databases and other storage that hold product information and customer orders.
 - #### A region is one or more Azure data centers within a specific geographic location.
 - #### A virtual network is a logically isolated network on Azure. A virtual network allows Azure resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.
 - #### Virtual networks can be segmented into one or more subnets. Subnets help you organize and secure your resources in discrete sections. The web, application, and data tiers each have a single VM. All three VMs are in the same virtual network but are in separate subnets.
 - #### ***You configure virtual networks and gateways through software, which enables you to treat a virtual network just like your own network.***
 - #### A ***network security group***, or NSG, allows or denies inbound network traffic to your Azure resources. Think of a network security group as a cloud-level firewall for your network
 - #### Availability refers to how long your service is up and running without interruption. High availability, or highly available, refers to a service that's up and running for a long period of time.
 - #### Resiliency refers to a system's ability to stay operational during abnormal conditions.
 - #### A load balancer distributes traffic evenly among each system in a pool. ***A load balancer can help you achieve both high availability and resiliency***
 - #### Azure Load Balancer is a load balancer service that Microsoft provides that helps take care of the maintenance for you.
 - #### Application Gateway is a load balancer designed for web applications. It uses Azure Load Balancer at the transport level (TCP) and applies sophisticated URL-based routing rules to support several advanced scenarios.
 - #### A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users.It is a way to get content to users in their local region to minimize latency. 
 - #### DNS, or Domain Name System, is a way to map user-friendly names to their IP addresses.
 - #### ***Latency*** refers to the time it takes for data to travel over the network. Latency is typically measured in milliseconds.
 - #### ***Bandwidth*** refers to the amount of data that can fit on the connection
 - #### Traffic Manager uses the DNS server that's closest to the user to direct user traffic to a globally distributed endpoint.
 - #### Traffic Manager doesn't see the traffic that's passed between the client and server. Rather, it directs the client web browser to a preferred endpoint. Traffic Manager can route traffic in a few different ways, such as to the endpoint with the lowest latency.
